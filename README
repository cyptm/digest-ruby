Code Challange


NOTE:  Ruby was chosen as the language of choice because it provides the most flexible testing framework.
This challenge could have been implemented directly with bash using system level OpenSSL Libraries.
Other languages such as JAVA pose a greater challenge is Elliptic Curve (ECDSA) key generation is only faciliated via third party libraries

Enjoy!
